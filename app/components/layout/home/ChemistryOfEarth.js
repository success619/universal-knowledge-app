          Various methods were used in the past to find out the age of Earth.
          The most exact method is based on the study of the radioactivity of

          known rate that is known as its half-life. The half-life is not
          affected by external conditions. As the radioactive element decays,
          it's quantity in a particular rock decreases while the quantity of
          daughter element increases. Scientists are able to calculate the age

          The air surrounding Earth is composed of about 78% nitrogen, 21%
          Oxygen and I% other gases including carbon(IV) oxide, water vapour and
          the rare gascs. Dust and air pollutants are also present in the
          atmosphere, especially in the big cities, and industrial and

        <NoteText>
          The lower layer (up to about 10 km at the poles and about 17 km at the
          equator above the Earth's surface) is known as the troposphere. This
          is the region where great changes in temperature and water vapour
          content of the air take place. It is the part of the atmosphere which
          determines the weather-clouds form here, and the rains, thunder and

          The next atmospheric layer, cxtending from about 10 to 17 km to about
          4S km above the surface of Earth is known as the stratosphere. This is
          the zone of horizontal air movements. The fast moving currents of air
          travel at speeds of up to 400 km h The temperature in the stratosphere
          rises from -60 째C at an altitude of about 10 km to 0째C at about 45 km,
          This increase in temperature is due to the absorption of ultraviolet
          radiation by the ozone layer in the stratosphere.

          Water forms a discontinuous layer over about 71% of the Earth's
          surface. Approximately 98% of the: total mass of water is in the form
          of salt-water the oceans and seas. Fresh water is present in inland
          lakes, in the soil (as ground water) and in the pores of rocks. Ground
          water flows to the surface of Earth as spring water and Hows into
          streams and rivery The permanent regions of snow, at the poles and at
          high altitudes, consist of frozen water. Earth is the only planet in
          the Solar System that contains large amounts of water. This water is
          continuously circulated through the hydrosphere with the oceans acting
          as reservoirs. Thus, water evaporates from the surfaces of the water
          bodies and precipitates as rainfall (or snow).

          Many substances are found dissolved in water. The most abundant of
          these is sodium chloride. The others are composed mainly of the
          chlorides and tetraoxosulphates(VI) of magnesium. calcium and
          potassium. Dissolved gases such as nitrogen. oxygen and carbon(IV)
          oxide are also present, with the last two being important for

        <SubTopic>Lithosphere</SubTopic>
        <NoteText>
          The lithosphere is composed of rocks and soil. It may be considered to
          be made up of three parts: the crust, mantle and core.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          The outermost part is called the crust and extends to a depth of about
          30 km in the continental areas and about 8 km in the main ocean
          floors.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          The portion below the crust is known as the interior of Earth. From
          studies of earthquakes, volcantc activities and other phenomena,
          scientists think that it consists of a nickel-iron (or possibly pure
          iron) centrat core, surrounded by a mantle. The mantle which is about
          2 900 km thick is thought to be plastic, 1e. neither solid nor liquid.
          The nickel-iron central core consists off a solid inner core and a
          liguid outer core: The diameter of the whole core is about 7 000 km.

          About a hundred different elements may be listed as components of the
          Earth's lithosphere. Of these Oxygen is the most abundant. It exists
          in combination with other elements. mainly as oxides. The next most
          abundant element is silicon, which is found commonly as silicon(IV)
          oxide.

          Most of the other elements are also found as compounds although a few
          exist in the pure state.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          The compounds of the lighter elements are found mainly in the Earth's
          crust and include oxides, trioxocarbonates (IV) and
          tetraoxosulphates(VI) of sodium, magnesium , aluminium and calcium.
          The interior of Earth is composed mainly of heavier elements and their
          compounds, e.g. the dense rocks in the mantle are composed of
          trioxosilicates(IV) of iron and magnesium.

        <SubTopic>USING SPECTROScOPY TO STUDY THE PLANETS AND STARS</SubTopic>
        <NoteText>
          When sunlight passes througha prism, It is dispersed to give a band of
          coloured lights known as a spectrum. Prisms are used in spectroscopes
          to disperse all types of electromagnetic radiation to give spectra.
          Nowadays, diffraction gratings are used in most spectroscopes instead
          of prisms since they give very sharp spectra.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          NoTE A diffraction grating, used in a spectroscope, is a polished
          metal or miror surface on which is ruled a large number of fine,
          equidistant, closely packed parallel lines.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>There are two types of spectra:</NoteText>
        <List>emission spectra, and</List>
        <List>absorption spectra.</List>
        <SubTopic>Emission spectra</SubTopic>
        <NoteText>
          These are observed when light from a source undergoes dispersion
          directly. For example, when light from a glowing sodium source is
          examined through a spectroscope, wc see a line emission spectrum which
          consists of two bright yellow lines very close together in a dark
          background. A glowing hydrogen source emits a spectrum with red,
          blue-green and violet lines.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          Usually, line emission spectra are emitted by atoms and ions which are
          not interacting. Band emission spectra which is composed of groups or
          bands of lines are emitted by molecules of glowing gases or vapours.
          Continuous emission spectra are emitted by hot solids, liquids and
          gases at high pressures where the molecules are close enough to
          interact.
        </NoteText>
        <SubTopic>Absorption spectra</SubTopic>
        <NoteText>
          These are observed when the emitted light passes through a material
          that partially absorbs it before it is dispersed. For example, when
          white light passes through a cool gas or vapour, a line absorption
          spectrum is obtained. Dark lines occur in the continuous spectrum of
          white light. These lineg Occur at exactly the same positions as the
          coloured lines in the emis sion spectrum 0T the gas or vapour. Thus.
          the emission and absorption spectra of an element arc the same except
          that in the former the enectum consists of bright coloured lines in a
          dark backeround, while in the latter it consists of darlk lines in a
          bright backgrund. As in the emission Spectra. band and continuous
          absoption spectra also obtained.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          Each element emits a characteristic line emission or absorption
          spectrum which can be used to identify it. Thus, by using a
          spectroscope, the chemical composition of the source that emits a
          particular radiation or the material that absorbs the radiation can be
          identified. Spectroscopic methods are extremely sensitive and can
          detect the presence of minute quantities of materials.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          Spectroscopy is used to analyze the light from stars and the reflected
          sunlight from planets to get information about the chemical
          composition of these heavenly bodies. Sophisticated astronomical
          spectroscopes and spectrographs (instruments which take photographs of

          revolve round the Sun. These bodies shine because they refiect the

          The sun is a medium sized plant but its energy and violence defy
          imagination. Every second, 4,000,000 tons of hydrogen are consumed in
          reactions which take place at its core where the temperature can reach
          15 x 10^6^째C(10 raise to power 6). All the earth's supply of oil, gas
          wood, and any other thing that can burm can only supply the energy of
          the sun for a few days.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          The sun. however, is like a hydrogen bomb burming slowly. Scientists
          estimate that in 8000 million years, the sun will exhaust its supply
          of hydrogen and in its desire to obtain hydrogen will expand and fry
          the earth. This they believe will be the natural end of the world.

          The density of the Sun is only 14 times that of water, while Earth has

          The solar atmosphere is composed of two layers-the lower layer is the
          chromosphere and the higher layer is the corona. The bright disc of
          the Sun from which light and heat are given off is the photosphere.
          Clouds of burning gas shoot up into space forming prominences. The
          dark spots on the Sun's surface are the sunspots.

        <NoteText>
          Analysis of the solar spectra from the Sun's corona and photosphere
          shows that the bulk of the solar gases is made up of hvdrogen. Helium
          makes up about 15% of the solar gases and a very small amount is
          composed of the other elements such as boron, carbon, nitrogen,
          oxygen, fluorine, neon, sodium, magnesium. aluminium, silicon,
          phosphorus, calcium and iron found on Earth. Most of the elements are
          present predominantly as atoms and positive ions in various stages of
          ionization. The emission spectra show that many electron transitions
          occur within atoms, especially of argon, calcium and the transition
          metal group (chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt and nickel), which are
          practically impossible to achieve on Earth. Molecules are relatively
          rare because of the high temperature. They may be observed on spectra
          from sunspots which have ternperatures that are lower than the other
          parts of the Sun.

          The Sun has a temperature of about 6000째C at its surface and about
          15000000째C at its core. This heat is produced by nuclear fusion
          reactions. The most important fusion process is the fusion of the
          nuclei of two hydrogen atoms (i.e. proton-proton reaction) to produce
          a deuterium atom, with a simultaneous release of a positron and a
          neutrino. The deuterium atom may collide with another hydrogen atom to
          form a helium isotope with an atomic mass of 3 and gamma-rays. Two
          such helium isotopes may collide to produce a stable helium atom with
          an atomic mass of 4, while releasing two protons and gamma rays. All
          these nuclear fusion reactions release an immense amount of energy.

          The Moon revolves around Earth once every 27.32 days. In the same
          period, it completes one rotation on its own axis. Therefore, the same
          side of the Moon is always facing Earth. There is no water or air on
          the Moon. As a result, it is very hot (about 120째C) when lit by the
          Sun and very cold (about -180째C) when it is not. The Moon's surface
          has many craters, jagged mountains and flat dustcovered plains known
          as seas.

          that intelligent beings lived on Mars. These ideas had to be abandoned
          after studies showed that most parts of Mars do not have water. The
          polar caps are a frozen mixture of water and carbon(IV) oxide. The

          oxide and water. The mean density of Mars is lower than that of Earth.
          This means that it may have a richer content of the lighter elements

        <SubTopic>STARS</SubTopic>
        <NoteText>
          Stars are self-lumninous objects, shining by radiation obtained from
          energy sources within themselves (by nuclear fusion). By contrast,
          planets shine by reflected light. Stars vary in age, size,
          temperature, luminosity (brightness), colour and chemical composition.
          The Sun is a typical star
        </NoteText>
        <SubTopic>Classification of Stars</SubTopic>
        <NoteText>
          Stars are grouped according to their spectra, which give information
          on their temperature, luminosity and chemical composition. These
          spectral classes are given the letters O. B, A, F G, K and M. They are
          arranged in order of decreasing temperature, from the hottest to the
          coolest stars. Stars in classes O to M are said to belong to the main
          sequence group. Other stellar classes which are outside the main
          sequence include the C stars and the S stars, which are the giants and
          the supergiants, and the white dwarfs.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          The stars in the main sequence have essentially the same chemical
          composition but their surface temperatures and atmospheric pressures
          are different. In addition, these stars also show a colour sequence-
          from the very hot (20000째C) bluish-white O and B stars, to the
          moderately hot (6000 째C) yellow G stars, to the the cool (3000 째C) red
          K and M stars.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          Like the Sun, the stars in classes O to M are composed mainly of
          hydrogen, helium and small amounts of other elements found on Earth.
          However, stellar spectra show that the particulate nature of these
          elements varies with the temperature of the stars.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          In cool stars, simple molecules and neutral atoms of elements are
          abundant, while in hot stars highly ionized atoms of elements
          predorninate. Thus, spectra of the cool stars of class M show the
          presence of simple molecules like titanium oxide and neutral atoms of
          metals like iron, calciurn and magnesium.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          The spectra of the slightly hotter K stars show that molecules like
          titanium oxide are not present although stable pieces of molecules
          like the hydroxyl radical are present.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          The spectra of the G stars are characterized by emission lines showing
          the presence of ionized atoms of metals like iron and calcium.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          The spectra of F stars indicate the presence of more ionized metal
          atoms than neutral atoms. Class A stars have spectra showing strong
          hydrogen emission lines (indicating unionized hydrogen atoms), while
          in the spectra of class B stars, these lines are faint indicating that
          most of the hydrogen atoms are ionized.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          The spectra of the very hot O stars show that even helium atoms are
          ionized, while oxygen, nitrogen and carbon are doubly ionized.

        <SubTopic>Life History of Stars</SubTopic>
        <NoteText>
          Stars are formed from massive clouds of dust and gas (mainly hydrogen)
          that are found in space. The particles in a cloud are attracted to one
          another by the force of gravity. As millions of particles come
          together, the cloud shrinks, its density increases and heat is
          generated. As the temperature at the core increases to over I000000
          째C, nuclear fusion reactions begin. Vast amounts of energy are
          released and a glowing ball of gas appears, marking the birth of a
          star.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          Most stars are formed in this way but their life histories vary
          according to their sizes at birth. The small stars live the longest:
          the medium-sized stars live for about 10000 million years; while large
          starS live for about a few million years.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          A star that is small at birth does not produce much energy. Its size
          or brightness does not change appreciably during its lifetime and it
          fades away when its store of hydrogen is used up.
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          A medium-sized star is very bright when young. The hydrogen atoms at
          its core fuse to form helium thereby liberating a large amount of
          energy. It cools slightly and enters its middle age, which is its most
          active period. As the hydrogen at its core is used up, the hydrogen in
          the outer layer (shell) of the star undergoes fusion reaction. This
          causes the star to expand into a luminous red giant. Meanwhile, the
          core contracts, becomes denser and the temperature starts to increase.
          At about 100000000째C. the helium nuclei begin to fuse to form the
          nuclei of heavier elements like carbon- 1 2, oxygen-16, neon-20 and
          magnesium-24 in reactions similar to the following:
        </NoteText>
        <Image
          style={styles.textSnapImage}
          source={require("../../../assets/galaxies/textsnap.jpg")}
        />
        <NoteText>
          These reactions stop when the store of helium in the core is used up.
          The outer layer or shell of the star usually drits away to leave a
          small star, the white dwarf (the core), which cools and fades away
          eventually
        </NoteText>
        <NoteText>
          A star that is large at birth produces much larger amounts of energy
          than the medium-sized star. Such a star often becomes a supergiant.
          When the hydrogen and helium in its core are used up in fusion
          reactions, the nuclei of heavier elements like carbon- 12 undergo
          fusion to form much heavier elements such as sodium. This happens at
          temperatures of about 700000000 째C. At higher temperatures than this,
          the nuclei of the transition group of elements (such as nickel,
          chromium, manganese and cobalt) are formed. If the temperature
          continues to rise, the nuclei of the transition group of elements tend
          to break down to helium nuclei in processes which use up enormous
          amounts of energy. The star collapses suddenly and explodes as a
          supernova. During this explosion, many types of nuclear reactions
          occur. A supernova is a rare phenomenon. If sufficient mass is left
          behind after the explosion, a white dwarf may form.

          The Sun was born as an average-sized star and probably will have a
          life span of about ten billion years. It is now a yellow G star which
          is in its middle age. It will slowly expand to form a red giant which
          may extend up to Earth. Then it will become a white dwarf when its
          shell drifts away. This marks the beginning of the end of its life as
          it slowly cools and fades into a cold black dwarf.

        <SubTopic>Light years</SubTopic>
        <NoteText>
          Astronomers measure stellar distances by light years. One light year
          is the distance travelled by light in one year, i.e, about 9.24 x 10!5
          m. So when we look into space to see a star, we are really looking
          back in time. Most of the starlight we see started on its journey a
          long long time ago. For example, light from Sirius (the brightest
          star) takes 87 years to travel to us on Earth. Light from our star,
          the Sun, takes only 8 minutes to reach us.
